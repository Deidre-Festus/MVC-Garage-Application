            <h1>Garage-Application:</h1>
            <p>Asp.Net MVC application. keywords: Asp.net MVC, C#, Entity Framework, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstap
The application has to do with Garage handling. The user will be able to park and unpark one of the four vehicle types i.e. airplane, car, motorcycle and boat which we use in the application.
At the same time the user should have full information about the parking time, the different types of vehicles allowed at the garage, and the user should also receive a receipt when it is about to unpark.
Finally the user should have the ability to search different types of vehicles or to search for a particular vehicle using any of it's properties.</p>

            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
            It has survived not only five centuries,
            but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
